1. Adjust evalues 
   a. Rigorous evalue for bacteriocins (10^-10)
   b. sagB (10^-5)
2. Look for longest ORF inside of blast hit
   a. 3-frame translation
   b. Find stop codon contained in blast hit (if not present, return entire blast hit)
      i. Use 3 frames (or 6 frames) (look at biopython)
      ii. return the frame with only one or less stop codons
   c. Later, find start codon (possibly outside of blast hit)
