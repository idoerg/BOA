Todo:

1) Identify the bacteriocins by intergenic regions and genes
1a) Create a script to generate a database of intergenic regions
2) Check for redundancy in blasted bacteriocins (check if the same bacteriocin is blasted to the same region multiple times)
3) Get a histogram for all_bagel_blast

Good Lab practices
1) Tarball from differently labeled subdirectories
2) Include a README for every tarball.  Needs to be clear enough so that it can be repeatable

<-- Forget about this for now -->
Build a phylogenic tree

All species can be placed in phylogenic tree and display a number for the number of bacteriocins for each species

1) Do this with the original BAGEL data
2) Research to make sure others haven't done this yet
3) Email BAGEL people again
4) Read Introduction to Computational Genomics Ch 5,7
5) Look at phylogenetic databases (e.g Greengenes) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=resources#Archaea and Bacteria

Download 16SRNA datasets for each species (nice barcode for phylogenic analyis), filter and try to build a tree from it.
