Todo:
1) Get a table with (cluster ID, length of representative sequence, protein function)
2) Only keep locus id
3) Print out text file with rows and columns labeled (also email pickle object)
4) Send pickle of bacteriocin sequences from top 66 clusters
5) Run Sean's bacteriocins (give IDs of .4)
6) Label sequences plasmid or chromosome
7) Start cluster numbers at 1

##
1) Make clearer labels on annotated anchor genes
2) Expand axes on anchor gene distance histogram
3) Make breaks in histogram just 1
4) Get locus tag for anchor genes (| separate all descriptions)
5) Don't look for CDS, look for gene
6) Remove duplicates in two ways
 a) Count locus tags only once
7) Add -d option to cdhit
8) Look at the clusters that have 10 or more members and classify them
9) Investigate to see if there are multiple different bacteriocins per anchor gene
10) Investigate how many species of bacteriocins are in each cluster
11) Correct aligned fasta format in bacteriocins
12) Get heatmap of bacteriocin counts/clusters
13) In each cluster, find out which bacterial species the representative cluster comes from
14) Plasmids/chromosomes

1) Identify overlaps
   Partial overlaps (same reading frame)
   Different reading frames
2) Plot distribution of overlaps versus species


Good Lab practices
1) Tarball from differently labeled subdirectories
2) Include a README for every tarball.  Needs to be clear enough so that it can be repeatable

<-- Forget about this for now -->
Build a phylogenic tree

All species can be placed in phylogenic tree and display a number for the number of bacteriocins for each species

1) Do this with the original BAGEL data
2) Research to make sure others haven't done this yet
3) Email BAGEL people again
4) Read Introduction to Computational Genomics Ch 5,7
5) Look at phylogenetic databases (e.g Greengenes) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=resources#Archaea and Bacteria

Download 16SRNA datasets for each species (nice barcode for phylogenic analyis), filter and try to build a tree from it.

Proposal:

1) Parse the 16S-RNA trees from http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Trees/.  
   Use these trees to identify how bacteriocins are distributed along the leaves
2) Build a maximum parsimony tree from anchor genes
3) Cluster anchor genes together to identify anchor genes
4) Cluster bacteriocins build HMM profiles from bacteriocin cluster and run HMMER on it
5) Start thinking about how to design a machine learning tool to identify bacteriocins
