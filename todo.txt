1. In blast.py line 161: SagB gene may not be annotated.
   Keep two options:
   a. Use annotated SagB
   b. Use homology to find SagB (finding sequences similar to SagB via BLAST) 
      Take only the first hit
2. Make input for findGene not case sensitive

3. Allow the user to look at more than one genbank file at a time

4. In the case that there are multiple SagBs per genome, look at all of them.
   Take all bacteria genomes in Genbank and find all genomes with multiple SagB genes via BLAST

5. Construct a sample set to show user how to play with data

6. Use ftp to download from ncbi
